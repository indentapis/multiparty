## Concepts

- **Rules** prescribe expectations for a system
  - Deterministic evaluation using Google's Common Expression Language (CEL)
- **Actions** run using WASM or Linux containers
- **Plans** specify ways to satisfy Rules using Actions

## Architecture

### üêö Client

- Lightweight language wrappers around Rust/Go core
  - Python
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Swift
  - Ruby
- Implements `check` and `enforce` commands
  - `check` quickly verifies assertions, e.g. don't execute if over budget
  - `enforce` provides async verification over longer windows, e.g. require user approval to be collected
- Support for local/embedded or remote engine
  - Embedded engine allows `check` without network connection
  - Remote engine provides centralized manage and control of rules

### ‚öôÔ∏è Engine

- Evalute **Rules** either locally or remote
  - Local for edge compute, testing, and single-tenant applications
  - Remote allows distributed and remote coordination
- Perform **Actions** in accordance to Plans
  - Dispatches WASM or containers for execution
  - Capture results and side effects to be used by Rules
- Durable storage for **Plan** and `enforce` calls
  - Execute Actions using either WASM or containers
- Signed decision chains skip the guesswork on why an Action was taken
  - Audit logs satisfy compliance requirements
- Budgets allow LLM-backed applications to deliver high quality UX with scalable costs

  <summary><b>How does this compare to existing rule engines?</b></summary>

<br />

**Rules** 

The Common Expression Language (CEL) is a non-Turing complete language designed
for simplicity, speed, safety, and portability. CEL's C-like [syntax][1] looks
nearly identical to equivalent expressions in C++, Go, Java, and TypeScript.

```java
// Check whether a resource name starts with a group name.
resource.name.startsWith("/groups/" + auth.claims.group)
```

```go
// Determine whether the request is in the permitted time window.
request.time - resource.age < duration("24h")
```

```typescript
// Check whether all resource names in a list match a given filter.
auth.claims.email_verified && resources.all(r, r.startsWith(auth.claims.email))
```

A CEL "program" is a single expression. The examples have been tagged as
`java`, `go`, and `typescript` within the markdown to showcase the commonality
of the syntax.

**Actions**

Calling external functions works out-of-the-box with multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc) with built-in caching. Read or write from any HTTP source.

**Tests**

Deploy automated systems with confidence that common sense controls are correctly implemented and easily tested.
